# Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains the solution to the projects I did for the ETH course "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence", held by professor Andreas Krause in Autumn semester 2021.
The topics are as follows:

## Project 1: Gaussian Processes

Implementation of a Gaussian Process regression. Then applied the model to an inference problem based on space data.

## Project 2: Bayesian Neural Networks

Coding exercise based on the theory shown in [Variational Inference for Neural Networks](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/nips_2011.pdf), implementing a simple Bayesian NN.
<br/><br/>

## Project 3: Bayesian Optimization
<img align="right" height="140" src="https://github.com/riccardodesanti/probabilistic-AI/blob/main/images/BO_1.png"></img>
Implementation of a custom [Bayesian optimization algorithm to an hyperparameter tuning problem](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Paper.pdf).

## Project 4: Reinforcement Learning

The task was to implement an algorithm that, by practicing on a simulator, learns a control policy for a lunar lander. The method suggested is a variant of policy gradient with two additional features, namely (1) [Rewards-to-go](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro3.html#implementing-reward-to-go-policy-gradient), and (2) [Generalized Advantage Estimatation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02438.pdf), both aiming at decreasing the variance of the policy gradient estimates while keeping them unbiased.
