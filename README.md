# Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains the solution to the projects I did for the ETH course "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence", held by professor Andreas Krause in Autumn semester 2021.
The topics are as follows:

Project 1: Gaussian Processes

Project 2: Bayesian Neural Networks

Project 3: Bayesian Optimization

Project 4: Reinforcement Learning
